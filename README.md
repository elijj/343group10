# -- ITINERARY BUILDER --

### What is it? 

Itinerary Builder is well... an itinerary building service. Users can search and discover events happening in their local neighborhood or another city in order to create a comprehensive itinerary of events. Users can also create their own events to add to an itinerary, which can then be shared with friends. 

### Why use it?

This is a very simple tool for anybody looking to plan a list of events to see when visiting a city or maybe plan a list of events for family members to have when they visit. 

### How to use it?

The landing page asks you to sign up for an account with a email and password. This account gives you unique access in creating itineraries as well as sharing them with others by assigning the itinerary a password.
